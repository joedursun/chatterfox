Chatterfox
==========

Setup
=====
Add chatterfox/chatter to your path
* ```[sudo] ln -s /path/to/chatterfox/chatter /usr/local/bin```

Usage
=====
This project is a work in progress, but it works for now. I only tested with Python 2.7, but it should work with at least Python 2.5

Assuming chatter is in your path
* ```chatter [ ip ]```

If the IP is left out, chatterfox will shell out a list of IPs on the network and you may select the one you want to connect to.
