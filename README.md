Chatterfox
==========
Chatterfox is a crude, lightweight, and completely unnecessary chat client. Just for fun. Enjoy.

Setup
=====
Add chatterfox/chatter to your path
* ```[sudo] ln -s /path/to/chatterfox/chatter /usr/local/bin```

Usage
=====
Assuming chatter is in your path
* ```chatter [ ip ]```

If the IP is left out, chatterfox will shell out a list of IPs on the network and you may select the one you want to connect to.
